<p>This extension allows proxying of non-HTTP traffic via Burp Suite. It adds 
the following capabilities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    A configurable DNS server. This will route all DNS requests to Burp Suite or
    to preconfigured hosts. It makes it easier to send mobile or thick client
    traffic to Burp. You need to create invisible proxy listeners in Burp Proxy 
	to allow interception of HTTP traffic or you can use the second feature of
    this extension to intercept non-HTTP protocols.</li>
  <li>
    A non-HTTP man-in-the-middle intercepting proxy. This feature allows you to create
    multiple listening ports that can intercept non-HTTP services. It uses
    Burp's CA certificate to negotiate any SSL connections, so that if the browser or mobile device is already
    configured to trust this certificate then the encrypted
    non-HTTP protocols will be able to connect without errors. It
    also provides the ability to automatically match and replace hex or strings as
    they pass through the proxy or you can use custom python code to manipulate the
    traffic.
  </li>
</ul>
